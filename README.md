# -A-STUDY-ON-IMPACT-OF-DRIP-IRRIGATION-IN-ERRAVALLI
The drip irrigation system is one of the water-saving technology which is used for the 
potential usage of the available water. The traditional form of irrigation is surface irrigation, 
where water will flow in the land to reach the destination of the plants, this will lead to 
wastage of water. But, Drip irrigation is a technology that will take the water directly to the 
root of the crops through the black pipes. This technology will increase the productivity of 
the crops. The findings are about the impact of drip irrigation in terms of resource use and 
yield cost of cultivation and farmer profits in Erravalli(v), Telangana, India. Despite many 
advantages in drip irrigation many farmers in the village have not used drip irrigation, so the 
findings also analyze the reasons for the farmers to not use drip irrigation, including financial 
constraints, water scarcity, damages by the animals, high maintenance costs, lack in technical 
skills, etc.,
